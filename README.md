## mothership project ##

In summer of 2012, we started collecting ~5 minute videos on various career topics in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/garann/3353532). It wasn't super clear where to go with it from there, however, and momentum kind of died. Then some people on twitter discovered the list in early 2013 and were excited about it, so now the project has its own github page.

The original idea was to provide a free resource for women developers who might have career questions, but not a female mentor to advise them. Rather than trying to pair people up to provide one-on-one mentoring (which a number of awesome projects already do), we wanted a library of the things we'd tell someone newer to the field on a specific topic. The goal was to keep it short and make a lot of them, so eventually we'd cover every single question any given developer didn't even know she had.

### contributing ###

Currently, we assume your advice is a video hosted on [vimeo](http://vimeo.com/). Record a short (<5 minute) video there, then fork this repo and add a file to the _posts directory describing it and yourself. Not sure what to put in the 'category' field? Current categories are:
- applying (as in, for jobs)
- interviewing
- professionalism
- negotiation
- conflict (as in, resolving it)
- money
- longterm

If you make a new one, be sure to also update this README so other folks can use it.

Once you've added the post, just make a pull request, and we'll get it added to the site!

### to-do ###

- add links to specific categories showing a filtered list of posts
- make a nicer looking design
- add a favicon
- allow other video hosts
- make more videos (always)
